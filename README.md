# Basic Payroll Tracker

## Description

This is basic a JavaScript web-app that focuses on tracking employee's names, and salaries and running basic computations on the data given.

- This was made to be able to apply my learning in JavaScript and basic data handling as well as interacting with elements on the webpage.
- I made this so that I would be able to apply my learnings from class and further increase my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript
- I will now have a functioning web-app that I can display to possible recruiters and or companies that are looking for freelance workers
- Though this was a complicated project at times, I learned a great deal about the ins and outs of basic interactions with HTML elements using JavaScript as well as taking in user data, and running calculations on said user data.
